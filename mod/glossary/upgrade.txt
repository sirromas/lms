=== 2.8 ===
* The glossary_print_entry_attachment function no longer takes an `align`
  or `insidetable` property. Instead the attachments are printed within a
  div whose class is `attachments` and which can be targetted using
  appropriate CSS rules.
* The glossary_print_entry_attachment function now displays the attachments
  on the left by default.
