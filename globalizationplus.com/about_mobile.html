        <p style="color: #910000;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">What is NewsFacts & Analysis?</p>
        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">NewsFacts & Analysis is a nonpartisan online current
            events teaching
            tool created by Professor Steve Posner to address the current events gap among college students identified
            in his post-presidential election research project which surveyed colleagues throughout the United States.
            Professor Posner's research revealed a significant lack of news awareness among college students which
            surprisingly includes political science majors attending the nation's most prestigious universities.</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Published weekly throughout the September—May
            academic year, NewsFacts & Analysis is especially designed to serve as an inexpensive course supplement,
            carefully crafted to provide reliable news for students without burdening professors with time-consuming
            lesson plans, preparation, and grading.</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Professor Posner teaches Advanced Writing for
            International Relations & Global Economics at the University of Southern California. "The focus of my course
            is on writing and not current events instruction," he explains, "yet even a slight increase in news literacy
            among students offers us an opportunity to underscore the relevance of political theory and history to
            today's headlines."</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">The convenient weekly schedule of topical
            nonpartisan content and brief assignments allows an instructor to remain focused on his or her core
            curricula while also providing students with current events reports that help keep them updated on the most
            important developments in the news.</p>


        <p style="color: #910000;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">What are the assignments?</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Each issue features an assignment that has been
            designed as a brief, simple-to-use online teaching module so it can be easily completed by students without
            the need for any extra instructor support. Whether used simply as an in-class exercise, the basis for
            classroom discussion, or strictly as homework, instructors can choose the approach that is most effective
            for them and yet in all cases, offering NewsFacts & Analysis to their students guarantees that they will
            acquire an impressive grasp of current events.</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Each edition of NewsFacts & Analysis highlights one
            major news topic. Every multimedia assignment contains four parts that combine text, video, student
            engagement, and testing consisting of the following:</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">

        <p class="news_items"><span class="tickbox">✓</span><span>News Backgrounder providing students with crucial facts about the selected topic</span>

        </p>

        </p>

        <p style="color: #910000;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">How is it graded?</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Students are automatically credited for their
            Discussion Board postings and graded on the results of the News Quiz. Teachers simply go to their
            personalized Gradebook to view or download the student grades.</p>

        <p style="color: #000;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Simple to assign and easy to assess, NewsFacts &
            Analysis delivers convenient supplemental current events instruction especially created for busy instructors
            with demanding core curricula and crowded schedules.</p>
