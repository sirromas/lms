Affirmative action began in the 1960s; it has benefited hundreds of thousands of minorities and helped in the creation of an African-American middle-class. The number of women in professional and managerial jobs has also increased considerably as a result of affirmative action. However, during the 1990s and continuing into the twenty-first century, affirmative action has become a contentious issue. While the bulk of minorities and civil rights leaders still support it, many conservatives claim that it amounts to &quot;reverse discrimination.&quot; Supreme Court decisions in 1995 limited the scope of affirmative action programs in business and education. In 1997, California banned preferential treatment for minorities or women in state hiring practices. But in 2003, in a case involving the University of Michigan, the Supreme Court upheld the role of affirmative action in education. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>							<div align="justify">								<p><span class="ds3"><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>affluence</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - weath or riches</span></span></span></p>								<p><span class="ds3"><br />										<b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>affluent</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - wealthy; an affluent society is one in which there is an abundance of material or consumer goods.

Anarchists believe that all government is corrupt and evil. Anarchism was a force in nineteenth century Russia, associated with Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921) and Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76) and the Frenchman, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. (1809-1865). Types of anarchism range from pacifism to violent revolution. American President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchists in 1901. However, anarchism has in general not been a prominent force in American political history. ** NOTE: The following email was received from Mr. Bill Walter, a college student: &quot;Your listing for anarchism in the political dictionary states that McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist in 1901. Leon Czolgosz was at best a self-proclaimed anarchist</span><span style='font-family:serif'><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - he was in no way involved with the movement, had only ever attended a handful of meetings, and was not known to be involved with the anarchist community. Further, he did have a history of mental illness. (See Spring or Summer 1997 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Fifth Estate</i> quarterly newspaper from Detroit) It is widely suggested in plenty of textbooks that McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist, but these texts frequently don't even name the offender, and very likely didn't spend much time examining the claims of previous texts. I understand that given the scope of your dictionary you are unable to offer full descriptions of the intricacies of political terms, but to use up one of the few sentences on the topic with such a half-truth is a disservice to your web-site. Further, it paints the entire anarchist movement (which may not be a major force in American politics, but it does still exist here) as being homicidal maniacs. </span></span></span></span></span><span class="ds3"><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"><br />											<br />										</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>annexation</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - the act by which one state takes possession of another state or territory, usually a smaller one, without the consent of the party being taken over. For example, in 1938 German troops invaded Austria and annexed it.

Anti-communism was the defining mark of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War, which sought to check Soviet expansion around the globe. In domestic politics, being seen as &quot;tough on communism&quot; was often a litmus test for American politicians; anything less was to court electoral disaster. Anti-communism reached an extreme during the McCarthy era, in the early 1950s, when Senator Joseph McCarthy led an unscrupulous witchhunt to root out alleged communist sympathizers in U.S. government service.<br />																<br />															</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>anti-Semitism</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - hostility towards Jews. Anti-semitism is as old as Christian civilization. Jews were despised because, according to Christian belief, they had rejected Christ and continued to practice a religion that was not the true one. During the nineteenth century anti-Semitism became racial rather than religious. Jews were persecuted for being Jews, not for practising a particular religion. Anti-semitism was found throughout nineteenth century Europe, particularly in Russia, Germany, and France. Russian anti-semitism reached a peak in the period 1905-09, with an estimated 50,000 victims. But anti-Semitism reached its peak in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Jews were held to be inferior to what Nazis described as the Aryan master race. Jews were held as the scapegoat for all the ills suffered by the Germans. They were deprived of all their civil rights, banned from trades and professions; their property was confiscated. The persecution culminated in Adolf Hitler's &quot;final solution,&quot; which was the attempted destruction of the entire Jewish race. Six million Jews were slaughtered in concentration camps during World War II. This was more than one-third of the Jewish population of the world. After the war anti-Semitism continued in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, although not with anything like the intensity that it had had in Nazi Germany.

In political discourse appeasement has a very negative connontation. It harks back to the buildup to World War II, when Britain and France did nothing to check German rearmament and aggression, particularly the Nazi occupation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938. Since World War II Western politicians of all stripes have done everything possible to avoid having the term applied to their actions or policies in the international arena.<br />																						<br />																					</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>appropriation</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - money used to pay for government-approved expenditures.<br />																							<br />																						</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>arbitrary</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - derived from opinion, random choice, or chance.

Keeping the balance of power on the European continent was a cornerstone of British diplomacy???the concept being that if one power or coalition of powers got too strong, the weaker states would make an alliance to combat it. Alliances therefore were not a matter of ideology but of simple pragmatism; they would continually shift to maintain the balance of power. In that way an equilibrium was maintained which discouraged wars. After World War II, in the nuclear age, the idea of the balance of power was in some ways superceded by what was termed the &quot;balance of terror,&quot; but balance of power diplomacy is always present in one form or another. For example in the 1980s, the U.S. supported Iraq in its war against Iran because it did not want Iran to become the dominant power in the region. Strengthening Iraq maintained the regional balance of power. Critics of the U.S. war against Iraq, begun in 2003, claim that it resulted in altering the balance of power in the region, weakening Iraq and strengthening Iran. Balance of power politics was also a factor in the U.S. decision to normalize relations with Vietnam in the 1990s. A strong Vietnam, it was believed, would act as a check on the hegemony of China in the region.<br />																																									<br />																																								</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>balance of terror</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - the phrase was coined by British prime minister Winston Churchill (1874-1965). It refers to the situation during the Cold War, when both the United States and the Soviet Union had the capacity to destroy each other with nuclear weapons. In the event of war, the destruction on both sides would have been so huge that neither side was prepared to risk starting such a conflict. A balance of terror existed. The doctrine of MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) was a later variant of the idea of the balance of terror.<br />																																										<br />																																									</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>balance of trade</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - the balance between what a country spends on imports and what it earns by exports. A favorable balance of trade is when revenue from exports is greater than expenditure on imports.<br />																																											<br />																																										</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>balanced budget</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a budget in which expenditure is equal to, or not greater than, income. In the United States in the 1990s, there was concern about the federal budget deficit, and a proposal for a constitutional amendment that required the federal government to balance its budget annually passed the House of Representatives in 1995. It was, however, defeated in the Senate. Burgeoning budgetdeficits in the first decade of the twenty-first century have led to a renewal of calls for a balanced federal budget. Some economists, however, argue that an unbalanced budget may not always be bad. Sometimes it is necessary to go into debt to ensure a stable future. For example, almost all states have laws that require them to balance their budgets each year, but they will issue bonds to finance large projects that are not within their annual budgets.<br />																																												<br />																																											</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>balkanization</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - to break up into small, hostile units, as happened to the Balkan states (Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Turkey and Romania) after World War I. A more recent example occurred in Lebanon during the 1980s, when the country split up into many warring factions with no central authority. The term &quot;Lebanonization&quot; was for a while used as the equivalent of balkanization.<br />																																													<br />																																												</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>ballistic missiles</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - long-range missiles that are mechanically guided only on the first part of their flights, after which they move under the force of gravity only, i.e. they become free-falling objects as they approach their target. Ballistic missiles are accurate and fast. They can cross an entire continent in thirty minutes and have great destructive power.<br />																																														<br />																																													</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>ballot</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a printed piece of paper on which a voter indicates his or her preference from a list of individual candidates or parties; the act of voting or the entire number of votes cast at an election.<br />																																															<br />																																														</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>barter</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - to exchange goods or commodities without the use of money.<br />																																																<br />																																															</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>belligerency</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - the term belligerent is used to refer to countries that are at war. International law grants to groups involved in an insurrection in their own country the status of belligerency, which means they are given the rights and obligations of a state to the extent that this is necessary for the prosecution of the civil war.<br />																																																	<br />																																																</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bias</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - an inclination or prejudice that prevents objective judgment of something, as in hiring practices showed a bias against minorities.<br />																																																		<br />																																																	</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bicameral</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - two separate legislative chambers.<br />																																																			<br />																																																		</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bicameral government</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a government that consists of two legislative bodies rather than one. The U.S. has a bicameral system, since both the House of Representatives and the Senate have to approve a bill before it can become law. All U.S. states have bicameral legislatures, with the exception of Nebraska, which has a unicameral system.<br />																																																				<br />																																																			</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>big stick</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - to carry a big stick is when an individual, group, or nation backs up their demands with a credible threat of force or some other pressure that is sufficient to get the other party to accede to their wishes. The term was coined by President Theodore Roosevelt who said that a nation, like a man, should &quot;tread softly but carry a big stick.&quot;<br />																																																					<br />																																																				</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bilateral</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - involving two parties; as in a bilateral trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan.<br />																																																						<br />																																																					</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bilateralism</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - joint economic or security policies between two nations. Bilateralism may refer to trade agreements, or to military treaties and alliances. It also refers to cooperation betwen allies.<br />																																																							<br />																																																						</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bill of rights</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - any bill that lays out the rights of individuals vis a vis the state. The Bill of Rights refers to the first 10 amendments to the U.S. constitution, which lay out individual liberties. Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison in 1787 that &quot;A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular; and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.&quot;<br />																																																								<br />																																																							</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bipartisan</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - in American political discourse, refers to policies that have the support of both Democrats and Republicans. Bipartisanship is often most apparent in foreign policy, in which it is considered advisable for the country to present a united front.<br />																																																									<br />																																																								</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>blacklist</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - in the early twentieth century, a list maintained by an employer of workers who had joined unions and thus should not be hired. Such blacklists were made illegal in 1935. Blacklist now refers to any list by any organization of individuals whom it disapproves of and whom it may take punitive measures against. In 1984, for example, it was disclosed that the United States Information Agency had maintained a blacklist since 1981 which contained the names of liberal Democrats and others deemed unsuitable by agency officials. The list was destroyed.<br />																																																										<br />																																																									</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>black market</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - illegal trading in goods, at prices that are higher than the legal or usual prices. In many countries in which consumer goods are scarce, a black market forms a kind of underground economy through which people get what they want if they are prepared to pay the price.<br />																																																											<br />																																																										</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>black consciousness</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a movement that emerged in the U.S. in the 1960s, on the heels of the civil rights movement that began in the 1950s. It refers to the cultivation among blacks of their own distinct cultural identity, and the realization that being black was something they could be proud of. Black consciousness tended to reject white liberal thinking about racial issues and set out to chart an independent course for black social and political progress. Black consciousness was linked to the movement sometimes known as &quot;black power&quot; that also emerged in the mid-1960s. Black consciousness was also a strong force in South Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of the growing opposition to the system of apartheid.<br />																																																												<br />																																																											</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bloc</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a grouping of individuals, groups, or nations who work together to achieve common objectives. A bloc can be economic, military, or political in nature. For example, the countries of Eastern Europe under communism were referred to as the Eastern bloc; the 27 countries that make up the European Union form a trading bloc; a group of legislators from different parties might come together on a certain issue and form a bloc to vote on that issue.<br />																																																													<br />																																																												</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>block voting</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - when multiple votes are cast by one group, on behalf of its members.<br />																																																														<br />																																																													</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>blockade</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - any military action by sea or air designed to isolate an enemy and cut off his supply and communication lines. In 1962 the U.S. instituted a naval blockade of Cuba (although it was called a &quot;quarantine&quot;) in response to the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in that country.<br />																																																															<br />																																																														</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>Bolshevism</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - synonomous with communism. The term comes from the Russian word bolshinstvo, which means majority, and referred to the party lead by Lenin (leader of the communist revolution in 1917), after it won a majority of votes at the Russian Social-Democratic Party conference in 1903. Used in the West in a derogatory sense.<br />																																																																<br />																																																															</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>bourgeois</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - used by Marxist theorists to describe anything associated with capitalists, including manufacturers, merchants, and small business owners such as shopkeepers. These groups were the opposite of the proletariat, or working people. Bourgeois has come to refer simply to the middle classes, those between the upper classes and the working classes on the social scale. The term is often used in a derogatory sense to refer to anything conventional, respectable, etc., as in &quot;bourgeois values.&quot;<br />																																																																	<br />																																																																</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>boy</span></span></b></span><span class="ds3"><span style='font-family:serif'><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>cott</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - to refuse to do business with an organization or nation, as when the Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Brinkmanship can be a way of testing an adversary's resolve. In 1994 Iraq massed troops on the Kuwaiti border, testing U.S. response—this was an act of brinkmanship on the part of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Hussein backed down, and withdrew the troops when it became clear that the U.S. would mobilize to repel a possible invasion of Kuwait. Much of brinkmanship consists of bluffing, but it can be a dangerous game to play if either side misinterprets the moves of the other.<br />																																																																					<br />																																																																				</span><b><span class="ds5"><span style='font-family:serif'>budget</span></span></b><span style='font-family:serif'><span class="ds4"> - a statement of estimated income and expenditure over a given period for an individual, group, government or organization.
