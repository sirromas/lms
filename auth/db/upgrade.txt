=== 2.9 ===

Some alterations have been made to the handling of case sensitity handling of passwords
and password hashes which previously varied depending on database configuration:

* Plain text password matching is now always case sensitive
* sha1/md5 hash comparisons are now enforced case insensitive (as underlying they are hexidecimal values)
