This files describes API changes in the block tag_youtube code.

=== 2.9.2 ===

* Due to the final YouTube API v2.0 deprecation we needed to adapt the current
  code to YouTube Data API v3. block_tag_youtube::fetch_request and
  block_tag_youtube::render_video_list have been deprecated as they can not be
  used any more.
